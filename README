[Note]
    first create a remote branch on server and then push data to server from client
    
    "git  remote  add  origin  git@github.com:SuperRxan/lua.git"
    ---> note1: git@ instead of git://
         note2: github.com:SuperRxan instead of github.com/SuperRxan
    ---> This operation add something in .git/config file
   
   [remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com:SuperRxan/lua.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
        
    "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    ---> This operation push data to server
    ---> This operation also config something in .git/config file
    
    [branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
        
    which means: 
    Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
    We can also use this command to set this config 
    "git branch -u origin/master"
